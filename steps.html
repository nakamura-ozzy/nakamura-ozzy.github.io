<h2>my recomendations for base makeup</h2>
<p>There are so many steps beginners miss when it comes to makeup. This is my guide for great products to get non cakey long lasting makeup.</p>
<h4>primer and moisterizer</h4>
<p>Primer is the most important step in your makeup. Your primer will help your makeup last long, look smooth, and give you a good canvas to work on.</p>
<h5>The elf poreless putty primer. the elf poreless putty primer is perfect for natural makeup looks with little produts used. It also looks amzing with a full face. you can find it at target or ulta beauty.</h5>
<h5>The elf power grip primer is and amazing sticky primer that helps your makeup last all day. It pairs perfectly with foundation. It can be found at target and ulta beauty</h5>

<h4>^foundation</h4>
<p>foundation is a perfect way to even out your skin tone. A godd foundation will make your face look hydrated and flawless. A bad foundation will look cakey or oily. Here are my recomendations</p>
